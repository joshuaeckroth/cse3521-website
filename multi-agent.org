  - agents not functions (not functional decomposition)

  - keep agents small in size

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The motivation for this principle derives not from our theory of
multi-agent systems, but from the experience of software engineers
that the difficulty of designing, implementing, and launching
computer-based systems increases exponentially with the size of the
system. Small individual agents are easier to construct and understand
than large monolithic systems, and the impact of the failure of any
single agent will be minimal. In addition, a large population of
agents gives the system a richer overall space of possible behaviors,
thus providing for a wider scope of emergent behavior. Very roughly,
the number of agents is a multiplicative factor in determining the
implementation effort, but an exponent in determining the size of the
overall system state space. The effort to code $100$ agents with $10$
behaviors each is on the order of $100*10 = 10^3$, but the resulting
state space is on the order of $10^{100}$.

  - keep agents small in time (forgetful)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Naturally occurring agent systems can forget. Pheromones evaporate,
and as a result obsolete paths leading to depleted food sources
disappear rather than misleading members of the colony. The
probability that a wasp will forage decreases as it successfully
resists stimulation. Even the death of unsuccessful organisms in an
ecosystem is an important mechanism for freeing up resources so that
better adapted organisms can flourish.
#+END_QUOTE

  - keep agents small in scope (local sensing and action)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Software engineering offers another argument for local agent
communications. [Dijkstra 1968] warned of the dangers of the Fortran
GOTO statement, which gave the programmer the ability to jump from
anywhere to anywhere in a program. This powerful tool led to tangled
mazes of spaghetti code that were easy to break and almost impossible
to correct and maintain. More disciplined structures proved to have
the same expressive power, while supporting modularity and restricted
interfaces that limited the propagation of faults. Global data
reference has the same kind of engineering implications that global
transfer of control does. In both cases, direct remote interactions
are difficult for humans to understand, maintain, and control. In both
cases, global effects can be obtained by propagation of local
influences, much more robustly than by providing global influences.

  - decentralized system control

    - avoids single points of failure

    - avoids performance bottlenecks

    - can grow more

  - support agent diversity

    - diverse agents cover more of the environment and provide better
      performance

  - provide an entropy leak

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Second Law of Thermodynamics observes that closed systems
progressively become more disordered over time. It is not obvious that
a large collection of agents will organize itself to do useful
things. The Second Law warns that the result of such an architecture
may be disorder.

Natural agent-based systems do organize themselves with striking
efficiency. A common explanation is that a system can become more
organized if energy is added to it from the outside (for example, by
the metabolism of the food gathered by an insect hive). The addition
of energy is necessary for self-organization, but hardly
sufficient. Gasoline in construction equipment can erect a building,
but the same gasoline in a terrorist's bomb can destroy it.

In natural systems, agents can organize themselves at the macro level
because their actions are coupled to a dissipative or disorganizing
process at a micro level. The system can reduce entropy at the macro
level by generating more than enough entropy at the micro level to pay
its second-law debt. To adopt another metaphor, it provides an entropy
leak to drain disorder away from the macro level (where useful work is
done) to the micro level (where it won't interfere with the system's
function).

In one model of this leakage, micro-level dissipation in the
environment generates a flow field that the agents can perceive and
reinforce and to which they can orient themselves. Insect colonies leak
entropy by depositing pheromones whose molecules, evaporating and
spreading through the environment under Brownian motion, generate
entropy. The resulting flow produces a field that the insects can
perceive and to which they orient themselves in making further
pheromone deposits.

Phrased another way, from "Toward the Specification and Design of
Industrial Synthetic Ecosystems" by H.V.D. Parunak, John Sauter, and
Steve Clark, /Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on
Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages (ATAL'97)/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Naturally occurring multi-agent systems often use some form of
currency to achieve global self-organization. The two classical
examples are the flow of money in a market economy, and the
evaporation of pheromones in insect communities. These mechanisms
accomplish two purposes. They provide an "entropy leak" that permits
self-organization (reduction of entropy) at the macro level without
violating the second law of thermodynamics overall, and they generate
a gradient field that agents can perceive and to which they can orient
their actions, thus becoming more organized. Wherever possible,
artificial agent communities should include such a currency. It should
have three characteristics:

  1. It should establish a gradient across the space in which the
     agents act, either as a potential field or as an actual flow.

  2. The agents should be able to perceive it and orient themselves to
     this gradient.

  3. The agents' actions should reinforce the gradient (positive feedback).

* Simulations

From: From "Appearances Can Be Deceiving: Lessons Learned
Re-Implementing Axelrod's 'Evolutionary Approach to Norms'" by Jose
Manuel Galan and Luis R. Izquierdo (2005) ([[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/8/3/2.html][HTML]])

#+CAPTION: Comparison of focusing on first 1,000 iterations vs. first 1,000,000.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This paper has provided evidence showing that the results reported by
Axelrod (1986) are not as reliable as one would desire. We can obtain
the opposite results by running the model for longer, by using other
mutation rates, by modifying the payoffs slightly, or by using
alternative selection mechanisms. These findings should not be
understood as a critique of Axelrod's work, which was developed when
the computational power required to undertake a thorough analysis of
his model was simply not available, but as a clear illustration of the
necessity to revisit and replicate our models in order to clarify the
boundaries of validity of our conclusions.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This paper has not only illustrated the significance of replication
but it has also highlighted some best practice guidelines that
agent-based modelers could find useful when developing their own
models. In particular we have shown the importance of:

  1. Running simulations with stochastic components several times for
     several periods, so we can study not only how the system can
     behave but also how it usually behaves.

  2. Exploring thoroughly the parameter space and analyzing the model
     sensitivity to its parameters.

  3. Complementing simulation with analytical work.

  4. Being aware of the scope of our computer models and of the
     conclusions obtained with them. The computer model is often only
     one of many possible instantiations of a more general conceptual
     model. Therefore the conclusions obtained with the computer model
     do not necessarily apply to the conceptual model.

* Emergence

Are the "emergent" properties that are sometimes observed in
multi-agent systems "real"? Do these properties exist independently,
do they follow different rules, do they play a "causal" role in the
system?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Emergent behavior is that which cannot be predicted through analysis
at any level simpler than that of the system as a whole... Emergent
behavior, by definition, is what's left after everything else has been
explained. --- George B. Dyson, /Darwin Among the Machines: The
Evolution of Global Intelligence/, 1997
#+END_QUOTE

Consider Adam Smith's "invisible hand" ("cooperation without coercion"
--- Milton Friedman). Smith says that when buyers and sellers act in
their own self-interest, the net effect to all of society is that
better products are produced more cheaply, which helps everyone. Even
though there are many actors, there appears to be a independent force
guiding the society as a whole (the invisible hand).

But is the invisible hand, and macroeconomics generally, a truly
separate force? Or is it "epiphenomonal," that is, just a shadow of
something else, and having no impact of its own?

There are two aspects of emergent properties that might lead one to
think there is something else going on:

  - Emergent properties are often hard or impossible to
    predict.

    "Hard" to predict is different than "impossible." Chaos theory
    shows us that some phenomena may be "hard" to predict but that
    knowing the rules and initial conditions, we can (if nothing else)
    just simulate each step to find out the final state.

    "Impossible" to predict means that /even given/ the rules and
    initial state, the outcome could not have been predicted. In other
    words, even performing a simulation does not produce the actual
    emergent properties. The prime example of this case:
    *consciousness*. One might believe that even if all the neurons
    and their connections of a human brain are set up in software, and
    a simulation of neuron firings is performed, the simulation still
    won't have consciousness...

  - Emergent properties seem to follow different laws. Examples can be
    found in psychology (e.g. Oedipus complex, obsessive
    compulsiveness, etc.), macroeconomics, group evolution (as opposed
    to the "selfish gene"), and so on. Moreover, these laws cannot be
    deduced or explained in terms of the lower-level processes
    (psychological states cannot be explained by neuron firings,
    etc.).

    Moreover, these emergent properties and their new laws can
    actually /cause/ the lower level to act differently. For example,
    the "invisible hand," as a distinct guiding force, can actually
    cause individuals to act some particular way. Or conscious states
    can actually cause neurons to fire a certain way. If this is true,
    then the invisible hand and consciousness are not just "shadows"
    of some other causal process, but are in fact doing the causing
    themselves.
