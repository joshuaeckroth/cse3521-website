How termites do it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>use pheromones

</li>
<li>metabolize bodily waste, which contains pheromones; this waste is
    what the mound is constructed of

</li>
<li>wander randomly, but prefer the direction of the strongest local
    pheromone concentration

</li>
<li>at each step, decide stochastically whether to deposit the current
    load of waste

<ul>
<li>the probability of deposit increases with the local pheromone
      density and the amount of waste it is carrying

</li>
<li>a full termite will drop its waste even if there is no deposit
      nearby

</li>
<li>a termite that senses very high local concentration of
      pheromones will deposit whatever waste it is carrying (even a
      small amount)

<h2 id="sec-2">Ants finding food</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
How ants do it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>five rules

</li>
<li>avoid obstacles (ants will not aimlessly push against a wall)

</li>
<li>wander randomly, in the general direction of nearby pheromones

<ul>
<li>if no pheromones are sensed, execute Brownian motion (uniform
      distribution of choices)

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>if holding food, drop pheromone at constant rate as it walks

<ul>
<li>maybe follow a &ldquo;nest beacon&rdquo;

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>if not holding food and finds food, pick it up

</li>
<li>if holding food and finds nest, drop food
</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>

<p>The initial path will not be straight, but the tendency of ants to
wander even in the presence of pheromones will generate short-cuts
across initial meanders. Because pheromone paths have some breadth,
they tend to merge together into a trace that becomes straighter the
more it is used.

<h2 id="sec-3">Ants sorting things in a nest</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
This model is described in the article <a href="http://ww.perada.eu/documents/articles-perspectives/go-to-the-ants-engineering-principles-from-natural-agent-systems.pdf">&ldquo;Go to the ant&rdquo;: Engineering principles from natural multi-agent systems</a> (PDF) by Parunak (1997).
</p>
<p>
This is the description from the article:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p><b>System Behavior</b> An ant hill houses different kinds of things,
including larvae, eggs, cocoons, and food. The ant colony keeps these
entities sorted by kind. For example, when an egg hatches, the larva
does not stay with other eggs, but is moved to the area for
larvae. Computer scientists have developed a number of algorithms for
sorting things, but no ant in the ant hill is executing a sorting
algorithm.
</p>
<p>
<b>Responsibilities</b> The individual ant algorithm that yields
system-level sorting behavior contains some behaviors similar to those
in the path-planning problem.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Wander randomly around the nest.

</li>
<li>Sense nearby objects, and maintain a short memory (about ten
     steps) of what has been seen.

</li>
<li>If an ant is not carrying anything when it encounters an object,
     decide stochastically whether or not to pick up the object. The
     probability of picking up an object decreases if the ant has
     recently encountered similar objects.

<p>
     In the emulation, the probability of picking up an object is <code>P =      (K+ /(K+ + F))^2</code> where <code>F</code> is the fraction of positions in
     short-term memory occupied by objects of the same type as the
     object sensed and <code>K+</code> is a constant. As <code>F</code> becomes small
     compared with <code>K+</code>, the probability that the ant will pick up the
     object approaches certainty.
</p>
</li>
<li>If an ant is carrying something, at each time step decide
   stochastically whether or not to drop it, where the probability of
   dropping a carried object increases if the ant has recently
   encountered similar items in the environment. In the emulation, <code>P    = (F / (K- + F))^2</code> where <code>F</code> is the fraction of positions in
   short-term memory occupied by objects of the same type as the
   object carried, and <code>K-</code> is another constant. As <code>F</code> becomes large
   compared with <code>K-</code>, the probability that the carried object will be
   put down approaches certainty.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
<b>Integration</b> As in path planning, the Brownian walk eventually brings
the wandering ants to examine all objects in the nest. Even a random
scattering of different items in the nest will yield local
concentrations of similar items that stimulate ants to drop other
similar items. As concentrations grow, they tend to retain current
members and attract new ones. The stochastic nature of the pick-up and
drop behaviors enables multiple concentrations to merge, since ants
occasionally pick up items from one existing concentration and
transport them to another.
</p>
<p>
The put-down constant <code>K-</code> must be stronger than the pick-up constant
<code>K+</code>, or else clusters will dissolve faster than they form. Typically,
<code>K+</code> is about 1 and <code>K-</code> is about 3. The length of short-term memory
and the length of the ant&rsquo;s step in each time period determine the
radius within which the ant compares objects. If the memory is too
long, the ant sees the entire nest as a single location, and sorting
will not take place.

<h2 id="sec-4">Principles for designing agent-based solutions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<ul>
<li>agents not functions (not functional decomposition)

</li>
<li>keep agents small in size
</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>

<p>The motivation for this principle derives not from our theory of
multi-agent systems, but from the experience of software engineers
that the difficulty of designing, implementing, and launching
computer-based systems increases exponentially with the size of the
system. Small individual agents are easier to construct and understand
than large monolithic systems, and the impact of the failure of any
single agent will be minimal. In addition, a large population of
agents gives the system a richer overall space of possible behaviors,
thus providing for a wider scope of emergent behavior. Very roughly,
the number of agents is a multiplicative factor in determining the
implementation effort, but an exponent in determining the size of the
overall system state space. The effort to code \(100\) agents with \(10\)
behaviors each is on the order of \(100*10 = 10^3\), but the resulting
state space is on the order of \(10^{100}\).
</p>
</blockquote>


<ul>
<li>keep agents small in time (forgetful)
</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>

<p>Naturally occurring agent systems can forget. Pheromones evaporate,
and as a result obsolete paths leading to depleted food sources
disappear rather than misleading members of the colony. The
probability that a wasp will forage decreases as it successfully
resists stimulation. Even the death of unsuccessful organisms in an
ecosystem is an important mechanism for freeing up resources so that
better adapted organisms can flourish.
</p>
</blockquote>


<ul>
<li>keep agents small in scope (local sensing and action)
</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>

<p>Software engineering offers another argument for local agent
communications. [Dijkstra 1968] warned of the dangers of the Fortran
GOTO statement, which gave the programmer the ability to jump from
anywhere to anywhere in a program. This powerful tool led to tangled
mazes of spaghetti code that were easy to break and almost impossible
to correct and maintain. More disciplined structures proved to have
the same expressive power, while supporting modularity and restricted
interfaces that limited the propagation of faults. Global data
reference has the same kind of engineering implications that global
transfer of control does. In both cases, direct remote interactions
are difficult for humans to understand, maintain, and control. In both
cases, global effects can be obtained by propagation of local
influences, much more robustly than by providing global influences.
</p>
</blockquote>


<ul>
<li>decentralizd system control

<ul>
<li>avoids single points of failure

</li>
<li>avoids performance bottlenecks

</li>
<li>can grow more

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>support agent diversity

<ul>
<li>diverse agents cover more of the environment and provide better
      performance

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>provide an entropy leak
</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>

<p>Natural agent-based systems do organize themselves with striking
efficiency. A common explanation is that a system can become more
organized if energy is added to it from the outside (for example, by
the metabolism of the food gathered by an insect hive). The addition
of energy is necessary for self-organization, but hardly
sufficient. Gasoline in construction equipment can erect a building,
but the same gasoline in a terrorist&rsquo;s bomb can destroy it.
</p>
<p>
In natural systems, agents can organize themselves at the macro level
because their actions are coupled to a dissipative or disorganizing
process at a micro level. The system can reduce entropy at the macro
level by generating more than enough entropy at the micro level to pay
its second-law debt. To adopt another metaphor, it provides an entropy
leak to drain disorder away from the macro level (where useful work is
done) to the micro level (where it won&rsquo;t interfere with the system&rsquo;s
function).
</p>
