<h2 id="sec-1">Generic search algorithm</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Here is the algorithm again, first seen in the <a href="./uninformed-search.html">Uninformed search</a>
lecture notes.
</p>



<pre class="example">1. create an empty list called "closedset"; this list will contain
   states that have been visited

2. create a list called "openset" that contains just the starting
   state; this list contains states that have not been visited but are
   known to exist

3. create an empty map (key/value pairs) called "parents"; this map
   contains the previous state of each state that has been visited

4. while the openset is not empty:

   a. grab a state from the openset (and remove it)

   b. if that state is the goal, hey we're done!

      i. return a reconstructed path from the goal state to the start
         state (this is easy: recursively grab parent states from the
         "parents" map)

   c. it's not the goal state; for each next state that is accessible
      from here:

       i. if this next state is in the closedset (it has been visited
          before), ignore it

      ii. if this next state is not in the openset, put it in the
          openset and record its parent

   d. (repeat the loop)

5. if the openset is empty and we never found the goal, oops!
</pre>


<p>
In the uninformed searches, the random search used no particular
technique for choosing the next state to check. Breadth-first search
(BFS) checked the earliest discovered state, and depth-first search
(DFS) checked the most recently discovered state.
</p>
<p>
BFS is probably the right solution if the goal state is not deep in
the search graph. DFS is probably the right solution if the opposite
is the case. Naturally, random search is probably never a good idea.
</p>
<p>
However, many problems do not fit simple descriptions like &ldquo;the goal
state is not deep in the graph.&rdquo; The goal state may be anywhere, and
in different occasions may be deep or shallow in the graph.
</p>
<p>
Rather than choose how to search based solely on breadth-first or
depth-first, we can often come up with better <i>heuristics</i>. A
heuristic is a &ldquo;rule of thumb,&rdquo; or some kind of rule that&rsquo;s &ldquo;usually a
good idea.&rdquo; BFS and DFS have their own heuristics but their heuristics
(how to choose the next states to check) do not change depending on
the problem. Normally, we talk about heuristics in a more
problem-specific sense. A heuristic would be applied in step <code>2.b.</code>,
in which we choose the next state to check.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Heuristics for 8-puzzle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Here are some heuristics we might apply to the 8-puzzle problem. Each
heuristic is a function of a state, i.e., \(h(s) = n\) where \(s\) is a
state and \(n\) is an integer:
</p>
<ul>
<li>(OP): The number of tokens that are out of place.

</li>
<li>(MD): The sum of &ldquo;Manhattan-distances&rdquo; between each token and its
  goal position.

</li>
<li>(RC): Number of tokens out of row plus number of tokens out of column.

</li>
<li>Perform a breadth-first search from the state to the goal, counting
  the number of moves in the shortest path. This &ldquo;heuristic&rdquo; is
  perfect; but it requires solving the whole problem before choosing
  to follow that state (which is ridiculous).
</li>
</ul>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Hill-climbing search</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
Imagine the search space as terrain. One or more high points on this
terrain (tops of hills) are goals. If there is only one goal, then
there is only one highest point. The idea with hill-climbing search is
to always &ldquo;climb&rdquo; upwards, toward a high point. Once you find that no
movement takes you to a higher point, then you are done. Note that you
may have only found the top of a local hill (a non-goal), not the top
of the tallest hill (the goal).
</p>
<p>
Hill-climbing search does not remember where it was prior to its
current location in the search space. It&rsquo;s also possible to actually
perform this search in the real world (by climbing, for example);
other searches that bounce around to different states or backtrack a
lot are harder or impossible to perform in reality. This makes
hill-climbing very efficient in terms of memory usage. However, if the
search arrives at a local maximum rather than a global maximum, it has
no way of fixing that error.
</p>
<p>
Our general search algorithm can be modified to support hill-climbing
search by modifying step <code>2.b.ii.</code> so that the entire &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list
is deleted and replaced with only those states accessible from the
current state. Also, step <code>2.b.</code> is modified to choose the best state
in terms of the chosen heuristic (&ldquo;climb up the hill&rdquo; means &ldquo;maximize
the heuristic function&rdquo;).
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Best-first search</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
Best-first retains a record of every state that has been visited as
well as the heuristic value of that state. At step <code>2.b.</code>, the best
state ever visited is retrieved and search continues from there. This
makes best-first search appear to jump around the search tree, like a
random search, but of course best-first search is not random. The
memory requirements for best-first search are worse than hill-climbing
but not as bad as breadth-first. This is because breadth-first search
does not use a heuristic to avoid obviously worse states.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">More sophisticated heuristics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
Unfortunately, both hill-climbing search and best-first search can
yield terrible solutions. Imagine a maze-navigating robot in a maze
that has some windows in the walls. The robot can sometimes see the
goal through windows. A hill-climbing or best-first search robot may
believe it is close to the goal because it can see it through some
windows, but in actuality it is quite far from the goal, and must
actually back up to make progress. Instead, however, the robot keeps
going deeper and deeper into the maze, enticed by the illusory
nearness of the goal.
</p>
<p>
If the robot simply kept track of how &ldquo;deep&rdquo; it had gone into the
maze, and if it had reason to believe that the goal cannot possibly be
&ldquo;this deep,&rdquo; it would back up before going even deeper.
</p>
<p>
In other words, there is more to an appropriate heuristic than
closeness to the goal. One must also keep in mind how many steps have
already been taken. For example, if we are solving the 8-puzzle game,
we should consider how many moves have already been made. If we are
planning a driving route, we should consider how far we have already
traveled (or planned to travel); perhaps there is a shorter route if
we abandon the path we are on.
</p>
<p>
Thus, a good heuristic function actually has two parts: \(f(s) = g(s) +
h(s)\), where \(s\) is a state, \(g\) computes the cost of arriving at \(s\)
from the initial state (the number of moves to \(s\) or the distance
traveled so far), and \(h\) is our heuristic, i.e., our estimate of how
far away \(s\) is from the goal.
</p>
<p>
In the 8-puzzle, \(g\) is simply the number of moves made so far (to get
to state \(s\)); in the routing problem, \(g\) is the miles traveled so
far. In the 8-puzzle, \(h\) is one of the heuristics described above
(OP, MD, RC); in the routing problem, \(h\) is perhaps an
&ldquo;as-the-crow-flies&rdquo; distance (i.e., Euclidean distance) from \(s\) to
the goal.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">A* search</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
Let&rsquo;s modify best-first search to use the new complex heuristic \(f(s)
= g(s) + h(s)\). This is the algorithm known as A (not A*).
</p>
<p>
If \(g\) is the number of moves made so far (number of &ldquo;hops&rdquo; in
the search tree) and \(h\) is always equal to 0.0, then we have
breadth-first search. Recall that breadth-first search is optimal for
unweighted graphs (graphs were the edges always have weight 1.0).
</p>
<p>
Actually, the A algorithm is optimal as well, even on weighted graphs,
if we keep \(h\) constantly equal to 0.0. This is because it acts like
breadth-first search, in that it always considers better alternatives
before going &ldquo;deeper.&rdquo; The A algorithm here is optimal on weighted
graphs because it simply considers the true path cost (unlike
breadth-first search), and proceeds from the lowest cost path.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, if \(h(s)\) always <i>underestimates</i> the true cost of a path
from \(s\) to the goal, then the A algorithm is optimal. If we call the
true cost function from \(s\) to the goal \(h^*(s)\), then we are saying
that if \(h(s) \leq h^*(s)\) for all \(s\), then A is optimal. When this
restriction is met, we call the algorithm A*.
</p>
<p>
An \(h\) that meets this <i>underestimation</i> criterion is an <i>admissible</i>
heuristic, and turns the A algorithm into A*, which we call an
admissible search algorithm. Furthermore, A* is the most efficient
algorithm (called &ldquo;optimally efficient&rdquo;) that uses some particular
heuristic. This means that any other search algorithm using the same
heuristic will check no fewer states than A*.
</p>
<p>
How poorly \(h\) estimates the actual cost to the goal makes one \(h\)
better than another. With \(h(s)=0.0\) for all \(s\), we have a very poor
heuristic (unless the cost truly is always 0.0, but then why
search?). Ideally, \(h\) is as close as possible (or equal to) \(h^*\) but
still underestimates (if not equal).
</p>
<p>
If \(h\) overestimates the true cost to the goal, then our search
algorithm will obviously make the wrong choices. It will move the
robot farther from the end of the maze rather than towards the end.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">Comparisons</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">


<p>
Here we have the results of some experiments with the 8-puzzle
problem. The breadth-first search (BFS) results are the 0
line. Results from other searches are shown as how far they differ
from BFS. So, if a search is higher than the 0 line in these results,
it performs worse (in all graphs, higher is worse); if it is under the
0 line, it performs better than BFS.
</p>
<p>
The x-axis in the graphs shows the complexity of the 8-puzzle
problem. Starting with a solved 8-puzzle, we perform some number of
random moves. The optimal solution to the puzzle is at most that many
moves (the moves we made may &ldquo;cancel each other out&rdquo; in some cases, so
the optimal solution back to the starting state may involve fewer
moves). Since random search performs so badly, we do not show its
performance characteristics in the graphs after 10 moves.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-7-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-1">Number of checked states (time)</h3>

<div style="text-align: center">
<p><img src="./images/search-checked.png"  alt="./images/search-checked.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We use &ldquo;number of checked states&rdquo; as a proxy for computational
time. Random is obviously quite bad. Interesting, IDDFS is also bad;
this is because, at least how our algorithm works, many states are
checked more than once when the algorithm restarts with greater depth
limits.
</p>
<p>
Notice A* gets to the goal fastest. This is because A* is &ldquo;optimally
efficient.&rdquo;
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<p><img src="./images/search-memory.png"  alt="./images/search-memory.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;Memory&rdquo; is measured as the maximum size ever encountered of the
&ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list. Hill-climbing search keeps the &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list the
smallest, overall, because it always deletes the list and creates a
new list with only the next accessible states.
</p>
<p>
BFS uses a lot of memory because it keeps knowledge of all accessible
states from every state higher up in the &ldquo;search tree.&rdquo; Other
algorithms generally prefer keeping knowledge of states accessible
from only the best states.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-7-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-3">Length of path (goodness of solutions)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-3">



<div style="text-align: center">
<p><img src="./images/search-path.png"  alt="./images/search-path.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We learned that A* is optimal (with respect to the path cost of the
solution). Breadth-first search is also optimal since we have a graph
with edge weights all equal to 1.0. So, A* and BFS perform just as
well, and nothing performs better.
</p>
<p>
Hill-climbing and best-first search got lost &ldquo;in the weeds,&rdquo; producing
terrible solutions, because they do not consider the complexity if
their search path (the depth of their search tree). They just keep
searching further. DFS would do the same except that we are using
IDDFS instead (depth-limited DFS); IDDFS finds shorter solutions
before longer solutions, and thus nearly always finds the optimal
solution. Interestingly, random search finds near-optimal solutions,
possibly because it is more likely it will look at a shallow node
(there are up to four from each state) than a deep node.

<p>
    A* and best-first again find the best paths, which aren&rsquo;t any
    better than those found by breadth-first, since all movements cost
    the same.
</p>
<p>
    However, A* considers far fewer states. Hillclimbing likewise, but
    hillclimbing is terrible for finding optimal paths (in this case).
</p>
<p>
    As expected, depth-first also does not find short paths.
