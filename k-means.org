#+TITLE: k-means clustering

Suppose we measure some properties of flowers, species of iris to be
precise (data available from [[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris][UCI]]). We have a table like the following:

| Sepal length (cm) | Sepal width (cm) | Petal length (cm) | Petal width (cm) |
|-------------------+------------------+-------------------+------------------|
| 5.1               | 3.5              | 1.4               | 0.2              |
| 4.9               | 3.0              | 1.4               | 0.2              |
| 4.7               | 3.2              | 1.3               | 0.2              |
| ...               | ...              | ...               | ...              | 

Here are two plots of these data.

There are more plots we could study (e.g. Sepal width vs. Petal
length, etc.). However, sometimes we may have many more than just four
dimensions in our data. Plotting is not always the best way to study
the data.

* Clustering

We want to know if there are more than one distinct kinds of iris
plants represented in these data. In other words, we want to classify
each measured flower as some species of iris. But we don't know, a
priori, which points belong in which groups. We see in the second
graph that, most likely, the bottom left cluster of points is a likely
a distinct group.

There exist many algorithms to automatically cluster data like
these. We'll look at the simplest, which is called k-means.

* k-means clustering

The k-means algorithm is the simplest and most intuitive. It works as
follows.

  1. Decide how many clusters we want. Call this $k$. (Because we have
     to choose $k$, this method is "semi-supervised" rather than
     wholly "unsupervised.")

  2. Create $k$ random cluster means (also called "centroids"). Our
     data come in four dimensions; thus, each cluster mean will be
     four-dimensional. We can choose random values for each dimension
     for each of the $k$ clusters or we can choose a random data point
     to represent each initial cluster mean.

  3. For each measured flower (each row in the table of data), use
     Euclidean distance (which works in any number of dimensions) to
     determine which cluster's mean is closest to the
     measurements. Assign this flower to that cluster. (Note it may
     have already been assigned to that cluster.)

  4. Now that all flowers have been assigned (or reassigned) to
     clusters, recalculate the cluster means. This simply involves
     summing all data vectors in the cluster and dividing by the
     number of members in the cluster.

  5. Go back to step 3 until no cluster assignments change.

[[http://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/1.html][View an animation of k-means.]]

The result is each flower (each row in the table) is assigned to a
cluster. We can graph these clusters with color.

#+END_CENTER

If we get a new set of measurements for a new plant, we can predict
(approximate, guess) its membership in one of the clusters by finding
which cluster mean is closest.

Unfortunately, these clusters are not entirely accurate. The following
graphs show the real clusters.

** Confusion matrix

We can think of k-means as a classifier, at least in the sense that it
is attempting to group same-class data together. An easy way to
understand exactly how badly, and in what ways, the classifier
misclassified is to write a confusion matrix:

|  0 |  1 |  2 |                 |
|----+----+----+-----------------|
|  0 | 28 | 22 | Iris-setosa     |
| 47 |  3 |  0 | Iris-versicolor |
| 50 |  0 |  0 | Iris-virginica  |

In a confusion matrix, the predicted class labels (0, 1, 2) are
written along the top (column names). The true class labels
(Iris-setosa, etc.) are written along the right side. Each cell in the
matrix is a count of how many instances of a true class where
classified as each of the predicted classes.

With a confusion matrix, we can see at a glance whether some true
class is very confused. A perfect classification will produce a
confusion matrix with all zeros except on the diagonal. A confused
classification will have large values not on the diagonal.

** Voronoi diagram

If we look at a random x,y coordinate in the cluster graph, we will
find that one cluster (one mean) is closest. Thus we can color each
x,y point (each pixel) with the color of its assigned cluster. The
result is a digram that divides the whole space into cells. The
borders between cells are exactly half-way between the two closest
cluster means. This kind of diagram is called a Voronoi diagram (named
after Georgy Voronoi).

These diagrams are actually quite useful in many areas of AI. For
example, consider a robot navigating through a building. Draw walls
and other obstacles with points. Then construct the Vornoi diagram;
the Voronoi borders will be equidistant between the nearest walls. If
the robot simply follows these Voronoi borders, then it will stay as
far away from the walls as is physically possible. This is usually the
safest route for a robot. A visualization of this process can be found
at [[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~pblaer/projects/path_planner/][Robot Path Planning Using Generalized Voronoi Diagrams]].

** Benefits of k-means

  - Very simple algorithm.

  - Reasonably fast (although its "worst case" behavior is poor).

** Drawbacks of k-means

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A key limitation of k-means is its cluster model. The concept is based
on spherical clusters that are separable in a way so that the mean
value converges towards the cluster center. The clusters are expected
to be of similar size, so that the assignment to the nearest cluster
center is the correct assignment. When for example applying k-means
with a value of $k=3$ onto the well-known Iris flower data set, the
result often fails to separate the three Iris species contained in the
data set. With $k=2$, the two visible clusters (one containing two
species) will be discovered, whereas with $k=3$ one of the two
clusters will be split into two even parts. In fact, $k=2$ is more
appropriate for this data set, despite the data set containing 3
classes. As with any other clustering algorithm, the k-means result
relies on the data set to satisfy the assumptions made by the
clustering algorithms. It works well on some data sets, while failing
on others. ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering][Wikipedia]])

** How to choose k

Check out the Wikipedia article about calculating the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)][silhouette]],
which is a measure of the average dissimilarity of the clusters. We
can start at $k=1$ and increase it until we find a max silhouette (or
at least a "local" max).
