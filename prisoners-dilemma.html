<p>
Two men are arrested, but the police do not possess enough information
for a conviction. Following the separation of the two men, the police
offer both a similar deal—if one testifies against his partner
(defects/betrays), and the other remains silent (cooperates/assists),
the betrayer goes free and the cooperator receives the full one-year
sentence. If both remain silent, both are sentenced to only one month
in jail for a minor charge. If each 'rats out' the other, each
receives a three-month sentence. Each prisoner must choose either to
betray or remain silent; the decision of each is kept quiet. What
should they do? (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Wikipedia</a>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The "dilemma" faced by the prisoners here is that, whatever the other
does, each is better off confessing than remaining silent. But the
outcome obtained when both confess is worse for each than the outcome
they would have obtained had both remained silent. A common view is
that the puzzle illustrates a conflict between individual and group
rationality. A group whose members pursue rational self-interest may
all end up worse off than a group whose members act contrary to
rational self-interest. (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> (SEP))

<blockquote>
<p>
If two players play prisoners' dilemma more than once in succession
and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their
strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoners'
dilemma. (Wikipedia)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
If the game is played exactly N times and both players know this, then
it is always game theoretically optimal to defect in all rounds. The
only possible Nash equilibrium is to always defect. The proof is
inductive: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the
opponent will not have a chance to punish the player. Therefore, both
will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on
the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no
matter what is done, and so on. The same applies if the game length is
unknown but has a known upper limit. (Wikipedia)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The iterated version of the PD was discussed from the time the game
was devised, but interest accelerated after influential publications
of Robert Axelrod in the early eighties. Axelrod invited professional
game theorists to submit computer programs for playing IPDs. All the
programs were entered into a tournament in which each played every
other (as well as a clone of itself and a strategy that cooperated and
defected at random) hundreds of times. It is easy to see that in a
game like this no strategy is "best" in the sense that its score would
be highest among any group of competitors. If the other strategies
never consider the previous history of interaction in choosing their
next move, it would be best to defect unconditionally. If the other
strategies all begin by cooperating and then "punish" any defection
against themselves by defecting on all subsequent rounds, then a
policy of unconditional cooperation is better. Nevertheless, as in the
transparent game, some strategies have features that seem to allow
them to do well in a variety of environments. The strategy that scored
highest in Axelrod's initial tournament, Tit for Tat (henceforth TFT),
simply cooperates on the first round and imitates its opponent's
previous move thereafter. More significant than TFT's initial victory,
perhaps is the fact that it won Axelrod's second tournament, whose
sixty three entrants were all given the results of the first
tournament. (SEP)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Axelrod's properties of a successful strategy (like TFT):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>nice</i> &#x2014; it is never the first to defect
</li>

<li><i>retaliatory</i> &#x2014; cannot be exploited by non-nice strategies
</li>

<li><i>forgiving</i> &#x2014; willing to cooperate even with those who have
defected against it (provided the defection was not in the
previous round; TFT would defect in this case)
</li>

<li><i>clear</i> &#x2014; easier for other strategies to predict its behavior to
foster mutually beneficial interaction
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Wikipedia says this about how to find an optimal strategy for IPD:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Bayesian Nash Equilibrium: If the statistical distribution of
opposing strategies can be determined (e.g. 50% tit for tat, 50%
always cooperate) an optimal counter-strategy can be derived
analytically.
</li>

<li>Monte Carlo simulations of populations have been made, where
individuals with low scores die off, and those with high scores
reproduce (a genetic algorithm for finding an optimal
strategy). The mix of algorithms in the final population
generally depends on the mix in the initial population. The
introduction of mutation (random variation during reproduction)
lessens the dependency on the initial population; empirical
experiments with such systems tend to produce tit for tat
players, but there is no analytic proof that this will always
occur.
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>
The PD TWO PERSON ITERATED model demonstrates an interesting concept:
When interacting with someone over time in a prisoner’s dilemma
scenario, it is possible to tune your strategy to do well with
theirs. Each possible strategy has unique strengths and weaknesses
that appear through the course of the game. For instance, always
defect does best of any against the random strategy, but poorly
against itself. Tit-for-tat does poorly with the random strategy, but
well with itself.
</p>

<p>
This makes it difficult to determine a single "best" strategy. One
such approach to doing this is to create a world with multiple agents
playing a variety of strategies in repeated prisoner’s dilemma
situations. This model does just that. The turtles with different
strategies wander around randomly until they find another turtle to
play with. (Note that each turtle remembers their last interaction
with each other turtle. While some strategies don’t make use of this
information, other strategies do.)

<b>Can a player win by manipulating the other player?</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It would be surprising if any significant mathematical feature of [the
iterated prisoner's dilemma] has remained undescribed, but that
appears to be the case, as we show in this paper.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider two players, X (she) and Y (he). Press and Dyson show that,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>longer memory does not help; for any long-memory strategy that Y
could play, X can do just as well with a certain shorter-memory
strategy (X's equally-good strategy is calculated based on knowing
Y's strategy)
</li>

<li>player X can set player Y's final score to any value in the range
from the mutual non-cooperation score to the mutual cooperation
score, regardless of player Y's strategy; player X can do this
with a fixed strategy (i.e., the strategy does not have to change
depending on what player Y chooses each round); Y's strategy has
to be fixed, however
</li>

<li>player X cannot set her own score to any arbitrary value
</li>
</ul>

<p>
They also show something else. Suppose player X wants more than the
mutual non-cooperation score, which was her limit if she chose to set
Y's score to a particular value, independent of what Y was doing. She
can get more reward if she "watches" or "thinks about" Y's strategy as
they play. When X does this, we say X has a "theory of mind" regarding
Y.
</p>

<p>
If Y cooperates fully (at every step, the "Jesus" strategy; as might
happen if Y's score "evolves" since we have seen that evolutionary
approaches to the prisoner's dilemma typically yield cooperating
strategies), then X can get maximum benefit (maximum
extortion). However, since Y would be losing so much every time, an
evolving Y would evolve away from that cooperating strategy.
</p>

<p>
How does X get Y to cooperate fully? If X knows that Y is evolving his
strategy, then X can force Y to evolve his strategy into one of
cooperation, by giving little benefits periodically when Y
cooperates. X cannot achieve maximum score this way, but can still do
better than Y.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The extortionate strategies have the peculiar property of sharply
distinguishing beween "sentient" players, who have a theory of mind
about their opponents, and "evolutionary" players, [&#x2026;] but have no
theory of mind.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is worth contemplating that, though an evolutionary player Y is so
easily beaten within the confines of the IPD game, it is exactly
evolution, on the hugely larger canvas of DNA-based life, that
ultimately has produced X, the player with the mind.

<p>
In environmental studies, the PD is evident in crises such as global
climate change. All countries will benefit from a stable climate, but
any single country is often hesitant to curb CO2 emissions. The
immediate benefit to an individual country to maintain current
behavior is perceived to be greater than the eventual benefit to all
countries if behavior was changed, therefore explaining the current
impasse concerning climate change. (Wikipedia)

<blockquote>
<p>
In addiction research/behavioral economics, George Ainslie points out
that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the
present and future selves of the addict. In this case, defecting means
relapsing, and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in
the future is by far the best outcome, and that defecting both today
and in the future is the worst outcome. The case where one abstains
today but relapses in the future is clearly a bad outcome—in some
sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today
have been "wasted" because the future relapse means that the addict is
right back where he started and will have to start over (which is
quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult). The final
case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while
abstaining "tomorrow" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled
with an addiction. The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is
an obvious benefit to defecting "today", but tomorrow one will face
the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then,
ultimately leading to an endless string of defections. (Wikipedia)

The theoretical conclusion of PD is one reason why, in many countries,

guilt. (Wikipedia)
