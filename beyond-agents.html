<h1 class="title">Beyond intelligent agents</h1>

<p>Our prototypical AI system in this class is a single intelligent
agent. The agent acts alone. The agent has a knowledge base (facts
about the world) and some algorithms to operate on that knowledge base
(searching algorithms, for example).
</p>
<p>
This &ldquo;intelligent agent&rdquo; metaphor becomes stretched when we look at
certain other forms of intelligent systems.

<h2 id="sec-1">Multi-agent systems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Some systems utilize a collection of communicating agents. Each agent
typically has a specialization: some task that it performs better than
other tasks. A group of communicating agents come together to solve
complex problems, with each agent solving just a small part of the
problem.
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;intelligent agent&rdquo; metaphor is stretched here because no single
agent achieves the system&rsquo;s goal; no single agent possesses enough
intelligence to do so. Designing a multi-agent system requires
thinking both about each individual agent and how they come together.
</p>
<p>
Marvin Minsky, a founder of the field of AI, believes that the mind
takes this form. He calls his model the &ldquo;society of mind.&rdquo; In this
model, the mind consists of many independent agents that each perform
one small task (such as recognizing shapes, or responding to hot
things, or retrieving a memory, or coordinating among other agents,
etc.). Minsky was trying to develop a theory of <i>natural</i>
intelligence, so an important feature of the model is that no single
agent has a mind; each agent is too simplistic. Rather, the idea of
the &ldquo;mind&rdquo; comes from the quick, widespread, and possibly chaotic
interaction of the agents.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-2">Emergent intelligence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Minsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;society of mind&rdquo; model is an example of emergent
intelligence. An even simpler, and demonstrably effective, form of
emergent intelligence is ant and honey bee behavior. Each ant or bee
is very simple. Each effectively performs a random walk until it comes
upon some morsel of food. The ants do not even communicate the
location of the discovery; rather, other ants (<i>randomly</i>) find
themselves on the same path as a prior ant (paths are indicated by
pheromones) and follow that path rather than continue their random
walks. This second ant releases more pheromones (as they all do),
which reinforces the path and increases the probability that another
ant will follow it should another ant randomly discover it. Honey
bees, on the other hand, communicate a small amount of information
about their finding by performing the &ldquo;waggle dance.&rdquo; This dance
communicates the quality of a flower and its direction and distance.
</p>
<p>
Studied at an individual level, ants and honey bees are too simple to
be effective models for AI systems. They have virtually no memory and
little variation in their behaviors. However, when hundreds or
thousands of ants or honey bees are brought together, an intelligent
system emerges.
</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;ll practice with <a href="./ant-intelligence.html">ant intelligence</a> and look at honey bee
intelligence. Some modern AI applications that employ ant/bee
intelligence include network routing, airplane routing, computer
vision and pattern recognition, job scheduling, etc.

<h2 id="sec-3">Intelligence with almost no representation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
Traditional AI systems are cathedral-like constructions, with lots of
interconnected subsystems, complex rules for their interaction,
libraries of knowledge and formal procedures for using such
knowledge. This makes them somewhat brittle, since the
interactions among subsystems are so sophisticated.
</p>
<p>
However, Rodney Brooks has shown that an agent need not be intelligent
in order to perform well in complex environments. Must like insects,
his robots do not keep a library of knowledge and perform no search
algorithms. They just <i>continually respond</i> to data obtained from
their sensors. In a sense, all their knowledge about the world is kept
in the world itself, not kept in the robot&rsquo;s mind. If the robot is
designed to navigate towards the light, it does not try to keep an
internal map of where it is and where the light is; rather, it just
continually moves an inch towards whatever direction it currently
senses the light.
</p>
<p>
Brooks was a founder of iRobot, the company that created the Roomba
and builds many military robots. Most of their robots do much more
than seek light. By employing many fast, accurate sensors and a fast
computation cycle, their (huge) robots can travel very quickly over
very rough terrain while following a group of humans who direct the
robot with radio signals.
