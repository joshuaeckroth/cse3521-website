** Feature vectors

Documents are simply binary word vectors. No tf-idf transformation is
done.

** Category vectors

Each category vector is represented as a series of probabilities, one
probability per word (each vector dimension represents a word, just
like a document feature vector). Each probability means, "the
probability of this word being present in a document that is a member
of this category." Thus, the category vector has terms $C_c = (p_{c1},
p_{c2}, \dots, p_{ck})$, and

$$p_{ci} = P(w_i|C_c) = \frac{d_{ci}+1}{d_{i}+|C|},$$

where $d_{ci}$ is the number of documents in $C_c$ that have word $i$
(anywhere in the document, any number of occurrences), $d_i$ is the
number of documents in /any/ category that have word $i$, and $|C|$ is
the number of categories. We add 1 and add $|C|$ so that $P(w_i|C_c)$
is never equal to 0. (This is called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing][Laplace smoothing]].)

** Algorithm

We assume, for simplicity, that the occurrences of words in documents
are completely independent (this is what makes the method
"naïve"). This is patently false since, for instance, the words
"vision" and "image" often both appear in documents about computer
vision; so seeing the word "vision" suggests that "image" will also
appear in the document.

We further assume that the order the words appear in the document does
not matter.

Because we make this independence assumption, we can calculate the
probability of a document being a member of some category quite
easily:

$$P(\hat{X}|C_c) = \prod_i P(w_i|C_c),$$

where $P(w_i|C_c) = p_{ci}$ (from the definition above).

Now, Bayes' theorem gives us:

$$P(C_c|\hat{X}) = P(\hat{X}|C_c)P(C_c) / P(\hat{X}),$$

with,

$$P(C_c) = \frac{n_c + 1}{n + |C|},$$

where $n_c$ is the number of documents in category $C_c$ and $n$ is
the number of documents overall. Again, we use Laplace smoothing; this
allows us to avoid probabilities equal to 0.0.

Since we want to find the category $C_c$ that makes the quantity
maximal, we can ignore $P(\hat{X})$ because it does not change
depending on which category we are considering.

Thus, we are actually looking for:

$$\arg\max_{C_c} P(C_c|\hat{X}) = \arg\max_{C_c} P(\hat{X}|C_c)P(C_c)$$

We just check all the categories, and choose the single best or top $N$.

** A problem with tiny values

With a lot of unique words, we create very small values by multiplying
many $p_{ci}$ terms. On a computer, the values may become so small
that they may "underflow" (run out of bits required to represent the
value). To prevent this, we just throw a logarithm around everything:

$$\log P(\hat{X}|C_c)P(C_c) = \log P(\hat{X}|C_c) + \log P(C_c),$$

and furthermore,

$$\log P(\hat{X}|C_c) = \log \prod_i P(w_i|C_c) = \sum_i \log P(w_i|C_c)$$

So our multiplications turn to sums, and we avoid the underflow
problem. Rewriting again, we ultimately have this problem:

$$\arg\max_{C_c} (\sum_i \log P(w_i|C_c)) + \log P(C_c)$$

** Evaluation

These graphs show the performance of the naïve Bayes approach on
various datasets (compare with results from the [[./document-classification.html][document
classification]] notes). The calculations described above are
represented as the "binary" algorithm in the graphs. The "tfidf"
algorithm, as applied in a naïve Bayes context, uses slightly
different calculations that have not been described in these notes.

The book [[http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/irbook.html][Introduction to Information Retrieval]] gathered some published
results for classification tasks. We can see that naïve Bayes is
usually not as good as k-nearest neighbor (which we did learn about)
nor support vector machines (which we didn't learn about).

I also performed a Spam detection experiment, using the [[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase][Spambase]]
dataset. With naïve Bayes I was able to achieve ~80% accuracy.

** Benefits of naïve Bayes

  - It is very fast. In the table above, while naïve Bayes does not
    perform as well, it is significantly more efficient than either
    k-nearest neighbor or support vector machines. The latter, support
    vector machines, are /painfully/ slow (at least in the training
    phase).

** Drawbacks of naïve Bayes

  - Accuracy is low, as seen in the table above.
