<h1 class="title">The knowledge level</h1>

<p>For those new to the field of AI, the terminology may be somewhat
abstract. We talk about &ldquo;<b>goals</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>actions</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>perceptions</b>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<b>knowledge</b>.&rdquo; But what are these concepts? How do they work, where do
they live?
</p>
<p>
New terminology is often a feature of a field of study; perhaps,
terminology is partly what defines a field of study as separate from
others. But the terminology is not just a way for a field to
differentiate itself. The terminology is necessary to properly
understand what is being studied.
</p>
<p>
In the philosophy of science, there is much interest in figuring out
what constitutes an <i>explanation</i>. What is generally agreed upon is
that an explanation should tell a &ldquo;causal story&rdquo; by including
specifics about how various components effect each other. This causal
story should enable one to imagine how different system configurations
could cause different outcomes (i.e., the causal story should support
a mental model). An explanation should be non-obvious and should hide
irrelevant details. In short, an explanation should be at a certain
&ldquo;level&rdquo; of description; not too high-level as to be completely vague,
and not too low-level as to make the mental model, the causal story,
so complex that alternative causal stories cannot be worked out in
one&rsquo;s mind.
</p>
<p>
Imagine trying to explain the role of a four-chambered heart while
being restricted only to the concepts and terminology of molecular
chemistry. The role of the heart, what it does for the animal, cannot
possibly be described with such terminology.
</p>
<p>
Now, imagine trying to describe how to sort a list of integers (in
software) by using only concepts and terminology about logic gates,
resistors, capacitors, etc. While it could be done, the explanation of
the sorting procedure would be extraordinarily complex and, frankly,
completely unexplanatory.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, <b>imagine trying to explain the Oedipus complex (from Freud) in terms of neurons and synaptic plasticity&hellip;</b>
</p>
<p>
Explanations that are too &ldquo;high level&rdquo; are also worthless. We will not
gain any understanding of the heart, how it works and why we have one,
if we speak at the level of societies and nation-states (whose
constituents all have hearts).
</p>
<p>
The point is that <b>there are more-or-less natural levels of explanation</b>. The heart is best explained in terms of its role in
blood circulation and relation to other organs. How to sort a list of
integers is best explained in terms of programming language constructs
(such as lists, comparison operators, etc.). And the Oedipus complex
is best explained in terms of the id/ego/superego and childhood
experiences.

<h2 id="sec-1">A hierarchy of levels</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
These levels of explanation form hierarchies. Here is a hierarchy for
computer systems:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<p><img src="./images/first-two-levels.png"  alt="./images/first-two-levels.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
A feature of hierarchical levels is that <b>each higher level may be implemented by any next-lower level</b>. For example, the Java language
(that is to say, the Java compiler and runtime environment) may be
implemented on any computational device. All computational devices
(pencil and paper plus a list of rules, or hydraulics and tubes, or
artificial neural networks, or cellular automata, etc.) support the
same computations. The symbol and algorithm level can be implemented
on any device from the processor and memory level.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, a higher level such as Java or Turing machines is a
<b>specialization</b> of the lower level. A lower level (say, electronic
circuits) can have many more higher-level specializations than the
ones listed. Electronic circuits can do much more than run Java code
or carry out the operations of Turing machines.
</p>
<p>
Finally, <b>each level can be defined independently of higher and lower levels</b>. We can define exactly what electronic circuits are; it does
not matter how they will be used (maybe to build a computer, maybe
not), nor does it matter (mostly) how they are implemented (with
transistors or vacuum tubes). Similarly, programmers rarely need to
care, on a daily basis, about processors and memory. Unless the
programmer is working on a low-level system program or a very
high-performance program like a game, the details about computer
hardware are irrelevant.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-2">A new level</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
When we design and build AI systems, we find that <b>explanations stuck at the symbol and algorithm level are too verbose</b>. Usually, it makes
no difference whether Java or Python or &hellip; is used to implement the
systems we are designing. AI systems have something <i>more</i>; they
require a higher level of description than descriptions like &ldquo;how to
sort a list of integers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
In AI, we talk about &ldquo;<b>goals</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>actions</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>perceptions</b>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<b>knowledge</b>.&rdquo; A goal is something the system (the agent) wants to
accomplish. An action is something the agent can do (in order to
change its environment). Perceptions are observations that the agent
makes about its environment. And knowledge is consulted in order to
choose the right actions, based on perceptions, in order to achieve
goals.
</p>
<p>
Exactly how goals, actions, perceptions, and knowledge are implemented
(realized in code) is not important if we are only describing what the
goals, actions, perceptions, and knowledge <i>are</i>. Their descriptions,
their explanations, exist in a level above the symbol and algorithm
level. Allen Newell calls this level the &ldquo;<b>Knowledge level</b>.&rdquo;
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<p><img src="./images/knowledge-level.png"  alt="./images/knowledge-level.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We can explain how AI systems work using only the terminology from the
knowledge level. This is what gives AI its own set of terminology, and
partly what makes AI a separate field of study (separate from software
engineering, for example).
