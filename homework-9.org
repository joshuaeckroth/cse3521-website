* Task 1 (10 pts)

Draw a single perceptron that computes the OR function.

Be sure to give the weights of the two inputs and the bias
term. Assume the threshold function is that demonstrated in the
lecture notes (where a sum ≥0.5 causes a 1 to be output, otherwise a
0).

* Task 2 (20 pts)

Draw a small perceptron network that computes addition of two one-bit
numbers. This cannot be done with only one perceptron. Here is the
table of inputs/outputs:

| $x_1$ | $x_2$ | out 1 | out 2 (carry bit) |
|-------+-------+-------+-------------------|
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0                 |
| 0     | 1     | 1     | 0                 |
| 1     | 0     | 1     | 0                 |
| 1     | 1     | 0     | 1                 |

Use this perceptron configuration. Determine all the weights.

* Task 3 (70 pts)

Write a single-layer perceptron network learning algorithm. Use the
perceptron learning rule from the lecture notes.

The input file is specified on the command line. Its format is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
5620 64 10
0 1 6 15 12 1 0 0 0 7 16 6 6 10 0 0 0 8 16 2 0 11 2 0 0 5 16 3 0 5 7 0 0 7 13 3 0 8 7 0 0 4 12 0 1 13 5 0 0 0 14 9 15 9 0 0 0 0 6 14 7 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

#+END_EXAMPLE

The first number, 5620, is the number of examples in the file, with
one example per line, starting on the second line. The second number,
64, is the number of inputs (or "features") for each example. The
inputs are floating-point values (which includes integers). The third
number, 10, is the number of /binary/ outputs for each example.

The input file (partially) shown here is from the [[./optdigits.dat][optdigits.dat]]
(handwritten digits) input file (from [[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits][UCI]]). Each example has 64
integers representing pixels followed by 10 binary numbers (0/1), such
that the only 1 in this group of binary numbers is in the position N,
and this N is the true digit of the example. So if the example is the
digit 2, then the binary numbers are: "0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0" (first
binary number indicates digit 0, then 1, then 2, etc.).

I have written templates for you to start with: [[./perceptron-template.cpp][C++]], [[./PerceptronTemplate.java][Java]], and
[[./perceptron_template.py][Python]]. (Words of wisdom: Python is horrendously slow; my experiments
with this assignment show it to be 30 times slower than Java.) These
templates load the data file, build the examples data structure, and
print the weights of the trained network. You need to build the
network, train it, and finish the code that tests reserved instances
from the input file.

With $\alpha=0.01$ or so, and about 1000 epochs or so, you should be
able to achieve ~80% correctness.

You can also test, for debugging purposes, the [[./and.dat][and.dat]], [[./or.dat][or.dat]], and
[[./not.dat][not.dat]] cases. Your network should be able to learn these with 100%
correctness.
