<a href="http://phys.org/news/2012-03-ethical-robots.html">How to make
ethical robots</a>, Phys.org, March 12, 2012
</div>


<p>
Your self-driving car is speeding along the highway. A school bus
suddenly stops in your path. Does your car hit the school bus or
swerve into nearby traffic?
</p>

<p>
I believe the following questions need to be answered about this
scenario:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How are ethical situations observed and measured? What kinds of
sensors are required, and what kind of software is needed to make
sense of the data? (e.g., how is a cardboard box in the street
differentiated from a child?)
</li>

<li>What's the right choice? How can we be sure? Is it <i>computable</i>?
</li>

<li>How do we program the car so that it more-or-less reliably makes the
right choice?
</li>

<li>After your car has made the choice, and supposing it kills someone,
and supposing there is an argument that nobody had to die, how do we
determine who is responsible? Who goes to prison?
</li>

<li>Assuming there is a human in the car or able to teleoperate the car,
how do we ensure the car gives the human updates about the current
situation, and enable the human to take over the driving when
the computer goes wonky or the human detects a terrible situation?
</li>

<li>Are any of these questions new? What are the ethical dimensions of
an elevator door?
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Asimov's three laws of robotics are often mentioned in these
discussions due to their popularity:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a
human being to come to harm.
</li>

<li>A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except
where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
</li>

<li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Notice that these "laws" do not actually address any of the above
questions. Of course, Asimov used these laws as literary devices. He
explored instances when they are actually the source of confusion
rather than clarity.

<h2 id="sec-1">Elevator doors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
In case you were curious, here are the regulations relating to
elevator doors:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
2.13.3 Power Closing
</p>

<p>
2.13.3.1 Power Closing or Automatic Self-Closing of Car Doors or Gates
Where Used With Manually Operated or Self-Closing Hoistway Doors
</p>

<p>
2.13.3.1.1 Where a car door or gate of an automatic or
continuous-pressure operation passenger elevator is closed by power,
or is of the automatically released self-closing type, and faces a
manually operated or self-closing hoistway door, the closing of the
car door or gate shall not be initiated unless the hoistway door is in
the closed position, and *the closing mechanism shall be so designed
that the force necessary to prevent closing of a horizontally sliding
car door or gate from rest is not more than 135 N (30 lbf)*.
</p>

<p>
2.13.3.1.2 Requirement 2.13.3.1.1 <b>does not apply</b> where a car door or
gate is <b>closed by power through continuous pressure of a door closing
switch</b>, or of the car operating device, *and where the release of the
closing switch or operating device will cause the car door or gate to
stop or to stop and reopen*.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These are operational requirements. They make no reference to
"artificial intelligence," "software," or even "autonomy." I suppose
that means that regardless of how it all works, these requirements
must be met.

<blockquote>
<p>
The first law seems to require too much. A robot through inaction is
not allowed to let a human being to come to harm. Because humans
around the world are always getting in harm's way, robots following
this law would have an unending job of seeking out potential collision
courses and intercepting humans before disasters occurred. So much for
keeping the robot at home doing the dishes. Even if ordered to stay at
home (second law), the robot would depart for an eternity of
supererogatory service (priority of the first law).
</p>

<p>
The first law is contradictory within some situations. Consider a
situation in which a robot must harm someone in order to prevent harm.
For example, a robot surgeon must operate and replace a patient's heart
in order to prevent a fatal heart attack, but in order to perform the
operation the robot must first harm the patient by taking out his heart.
The subordinate status of the second law eliminates the possibility of
giving consent to violations of the first law. Suppose someone orders a
robot dentist to repair a cavity in her teeth. Consent should justify the
harm done, but the robot can't follow her order because drilling her
teeth or even giving Novocain will cause discomfort and the first law
takes precedence over the second.
</p>

<p>
Had Asimov's robots been instructed not harm a human, neglect a duty,
or violate a right unless such an action were based on a policy that
could be impartially universalized, they would have gotten into much
less trouble.

<p>
"Robots exist in an open world where you can't predict everything
that's going to happen. The robot has to have some autonomy in order
to act and react in a real situation. It needs to make decisions to
protect itself, but it also needs to transfer control to humans when
appropriate. You don't want a robot to drive off a ledge, for instance
&#x2014; unless a human needs the robot to drive off the ledge. When those
situations happen, you need to have smooth transfer of control from
the robot to the appropriate human," Woods said.

have to be able to protect themselves and also smoothly transfer

<blockquote>
<p>
If you wish to put ethics into a machine, how would you do it? One way
is to constrain the machine's actions to avoid unethical outcomes. You
might satisfy machine ethics in this sense by creating software that
implicitly supports ethical behavior, rather than by writing code
containing explicit ethical maxims. The machine acts ethically because
its internal functions implicitly promote ethical behavior&#x2014;or at
least avoid unethical behavior. Ethical behavior is the machine's
nature.  It has, to a limited extent, virtues.
</p>

<p>
[An ATM] must be carefully constructed to give out or transfer the
correct amount of money every time a banking transaction occurs. A
line of code telling the computer to be honest won't accomplish this.
</p>

<p>
Machines' capability to be implicit ethical agents doesn't demonstrate
their ability to be full-fledged ethical agents. Nevertheless, it
illustrates an important sense of machine ethics.

<p>
Bentham's theory is the epitome of the use of calculation in ethics
and is worth examining in some detail because it reveals what is
promising and what is troubling about ethical calculations. &#x2014;
op. cit.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
According to Bentham, utility is a property of an object whereby it
tends to produce pleasure or prevent pain. The utility of any action
can be measured in terms of the amount of pleasure it tends to produce
and pain it tends to prevent. Hence, determining what should be done
is a matter of calculating the utility of actions. The higher the
utility; the better the action.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moor's description of Bentham's "procedure":
</p>

<p>
Begin with someone whose interests seem immediately affected by the
act.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Determine the amount of the initial pleasures produced by the act.
</li>

<li>Determine the amount of the initial pains produced by the act.
</li>

<li>Determine the amount of the subsequent pleasures produced by the
act.
</li>

<li>Determine the amount of the subsequent pains produced by the act.
</li>

<li>Sum the amount of the pleasures and sum the amount of the pains.
</li>

<li>Repeat the process for each individual affected by the action and
then

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sum the sums for the individual pleasures.
</li>

<li>Sum the sums of the individual pains.
</li>

<li>If sum of pleasure is greater than sum of pain, the difference is
the general good tendency of the act; and if sum of pain is
greater than sum of pleasure, the difference is the general evil
tendency of the act.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>
Notice that Bentham's routine is incomplete as it stands. The
procedure instructs us to calculate the good tendency or evil tendency
of an action but does not explicitly furnish instructions for
determining how many actions to consider.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
The strong interpretation is that all possible actions must be
considered and the action with the greatest good tendency (or least
evil tendency) on the basis of utility should be chosen. [&#x2026;] This
strong interpretation, though probably the most popular view of
utilitarianism, undercuts one of its greatest strengths &#x2014; its
computational foundation.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
Another problem of an infinite or at least an impractically large
number of calculations arises in considering the consequences of an
action. Consequences of actions go on and on.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Yet, as impressive as Bentham's theory is from a computational point of
view, it is vulnerable to some well-known philosophical objections.
First, Bentham's hedonistic theory seems too narrow because it
considers pleasure as the only good and pain as the only evil. Second,
his theory downplays and even ignores important ethical concepts such
as the notions of rights and duties. Both of these objections point to
flaws in Bentham's theory, but, of course, they do not establish that
better ethical theories cannot be computational in nature.

<p>
During testing (before Nevada issues the final approval for the
vehicle),
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Unless otherwise approved in advance by the Department, a licensee
shall ensure that at least two persons are physically present in an
autonomous vehicle at all times that the autonomous vehicle is being
tested on a highway in this State, one of whom is the operator and
must at all times be seated in a position which allows the person to
take complete control of the vehicle, including, without limitation,
control of the steering, throttle and brakes.
</p>

<p>
The two persons who are required to be physically present in an
autonomous vehicle while it is tested on a highway in this State:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Must each hold a valid driver’s license that has been issued in the
state in which the person resides, but are not required to have a
driver’s license endorsement to operate the autonomous vehicle as
provided in section 5 of this regulation;
</li>

<li>Must be trained in the operation of the autonomous vehicle and have
received instruction concerning the capabilities and limitations of
the autonomous vehicle; and
</li>

<li>Shall each actively monitor for any aberration in the functioning of
the autonomous vehicle while it is engaged.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
&#x2014; Nevada DMV, Administrative Regulations - LCB File R-084-11
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The license can be revoked/suspended/etc. if (among other typical
reasons),
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[&#x2026;] the Department has reasonable cause to believe that any model of
autonomous vehicle or artificial intelligence and technology used in
an autonomous vehicle of the licensee presents an unsafe condition for
operation on the highways of this State.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014; Nevada DMV, Administrative Regulations - LCB File R-084-11
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Before an autonomous vehicle can be sold by a dealer, a certificate is
required that states (in part),
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A certificate of compliance [&#x2026;] must certify that the autonomous
technology installed on the autonomous vehicle:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[has a black box like an airplane]
</li>

<li>Has a switch to engage and disengage the autonomous vehicle that is
easily accessible to the operator of the autonomous vehicle and is
not likely to distract the operator from focusing on the road while
engaging or disengaging the autonomous vehicle.
</li>

<li>Has a visual indicator inside the autonomous vehicle which indicates
when the autonomous vehicle is engaged in autonomous mode.
</li>

<li>Has a visual indicator inside the autonomous vehicle which indicates
when the autonomous vehicle is engaged in autonomous mode.
</li>

<li>Has a system to safely alert the operator of the autonomous vehicle
if a technology failure is detected while the autonomous vehicle is
engaged in autonomous mode, and when such an alert is given, either:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Requires the operator to take control of the autonomous vehicle;
or
</li>

<li>If the operator is unable to take control of or is not physically
present in the autonomous vehicle, is equipped with technology to
cause the autonomous vehicle to safely move out of traffic and
come to a stop. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to
authorize or require the modification of a system installed in
compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and
Regulations unless the modification can be performed without
adversely affecting the autonomous vehicle’s compliance with the
federal standards and regulations.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Does not adversely affect any other safety features of the
autonomous vehicle which are subject to federal regulation.
</li>

<li>Is capable of being operated in compliance with the applicable
traffic laws of this State and must indicate whether the autonomous
vehicle may be operated with or without the physical presence of an
operator.
</li>

<li>If it is necessary for the operator of the autonomous vehicle to be
physically present in the autonomous vehicle when it is engaged,
allows the operator to take control of the autonomous vehicle in
multiple manners, including, without limitation, through the use of
the brake, the accelerator pedal and the steering wheel and alerts
the operator that the autonomous mode has been disengaged.
</li>

<li>In addition to the requirements set forth in subsection 2, the
certificate of compliance must certify that an owner's manual has
been prepared for the autonomous vehicle which describes any
limitations and capabilities of the autonomous vehicle, including,
without limitation, whether the operator of the autonomous vehicle
must be physically present in the autonomous vehicle while the
vehicle is engaged in autonomous mode. A licensed vehicle dealer or
a licensed autonomous technology certification facility shall ensure
that a copy of such a manual is provided to the purchaser of an
autonomous vehicle.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, the DMV can revoke/suspend/etc. the license if "the
Director or authorized representative finds that the action is
necessary and in the public interest." Furthermore, to make sure the
reason is a good one, "In any such case, a hearing must be held and a
final decision rendered within 30 days after notice of the temporary
suspension."

"It turns out the issues around 'autonomy,' adding to what the
machines can do by themselves, are not about autonomy but about
interaction. The more you can do by yourself, the more important your
interactions with others who would utilize or interact with what you
can do by yourself becomes important." &#x2014; David Woods, ISE 773 at
OSU, Autumn 2006 (<a href="http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/courses/ise773/class/F9F43990-C009-4D78-9945-2CC87FDC442C.html">recording</a>)

require less manpower, reduce the risks to their own soldiers, and can
expedite response time. &#x2014; op. cit.

<blockquote>
<p>
[R]obots with complete autonomy would be incapable of meeting
international humanitarian law standards. The rules of distinction,
proportionality, and military necessity are especially important tools
for protecting civilians from the effects of war, and fully autonomous
weapons would not be able to abide by those rules. &#x2014; op. cit.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
[D]istinguishing between a fearful civilian and a threatening enemy
combatant requires a soldier to understand the intentions behind a
human's actions, something a robot could not do. In addition, fully
autonomous weapons would likely contravene the Martens Clause, which
prohibits weapons that run counter to the "dictates of public
conscience." &#x2014; op. cit.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Given that such a robot could identify a target and launch an attack
on its own power, it is unclear who should be held responsible for any
unlawful actions it commits. Options include the military commander
that deployed it, the programmer, the manufacturer, and the robot
itself, but all are unsatisfactory. &#x2014; op. cit.

Robots are not stakeholders, regardless of the degree of
autonomy. Robots are stand-ins for distant groups; they are extenders
of human scope. They are at the "sharp end" of the system, the ones
that can act in the hotzone. We do not necessarily need to teleoperate
them, not exercise absolute control. Rather, there is benefit in
giving them some autonomy and reasoning capabilities. But the
challenge is to ensure the whole team is working towards the same
goals. The challenge is coordination: hand-off of control, signaling
and displaying relevant information, maintaining common ground.
</p>

<p>
The questions should not be "how can we reduce the numbers of humans
in the hotzone and increase the numbers of autonomous robots?" but
rather "how can we use robots, as extenders of our interests, as team
members, and enhance our capabilities while maintaining coordination?"
</p>

<p>
David Woods: "We have a track record of engineering success when we
focus on expanding human perception via remote perception (bringing
the world at different scales into the human perceptual scale), rather
than developing reasoning capabilities."
