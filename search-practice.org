* Routing from Dreese Labs to Goodale Park

In this example, our goal is to find a route between Woodruff & Tuttle
and the Goodale parking lot. The graph on the right shows how various
road intersections connect to each other, and the distance between
intersections (in miles).

- Initial state :: Woodruff & Tuttle

- Possible actions :: Every action is the same: drive to another
     intersection.

- Transition model :: Shown in the graph and the table; each
     intersection can access the other intersections which are linked
     in the graph.

- Goal criteria :: Our destination is Goodale parking lot

- Path cost :: Shown in the graph and the table; distance (in miles)
               to the next intersection.

** Map data

This map data is encoded in [[./Goodale.java][Java]] and [[./goodale.py][Python]] source code if you would
like to use it in a program.

Here is some Python code for converting two long/lat coordinates into
a measure of miles between them:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
# from: http://www.johndcook.com/python_longitude_latitude.html
def dist((long1, lat1), (long2, lat2)):
    # Convert latitude and longitude to 
    # spherical coordinates in radians.
    degrees_to_radians = math.pi/180.0
        
    # phi = 90 - latitude
    phi1 = (90.0 - lat1)*degrees_to_radians
    phi2 = (90.0 - lat2)*degrees_to_radians
        
    # theta = longitude
    theta1 = long1*degrees_to_radians
    theta2 = long2*degrees_to_radians
        
    # Compute spherical distance from spherical coordinates.
        
    # For two locations in spherical coordinates 
    # (1, theta, phi) and (1, theta, phi)
    # cosine( arc length ) = 
    #    sin phi sin phi' cos(theta-theta') + cos phi cos phi'
    # distance = rho * arc length
    
    cos = (math.sin(phi1)*math.sin(phi2)*math.cos(theta1 - theta2) + 
           math.cos(phi1)*math.cos(phi2))
    arc = math.acos( cos )

    # Remember to multiply arc by the radius of the earth 
    # in your favorite set of units to get length.
    return (arc * 3960.0)

*** Let's introduce an anomaly

Suppose we change the distance from High & 15th to High & 11th to 37
miles (originally was 0.37 miles). This modification is a proxy for a
traffic jam between these two intersections or some other similar
unplanned situation. A* will account for this change because its
heuristic is the composite heuristic $f(s) = g(s) + h(s)$, which means
that $f$ accounts for both the estimated distance $h$ between High &
15th and High & 11th ("as the crow flies"), and the cost $g$ of
traveling that distance (the traffic jam is accounted for here).

Best-first search, on the other hand (and hill-climbing for that
matter) do not take into account $g$, so they do not plan for the
traffic jam; they only plan for the "as the crow flies"
distance. Thus, best-first and hill-climbing will travel across this
jammed route and their solution cost will suffer as a result.
