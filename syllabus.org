#+TITLE: Syllabus and introduction

* What this course is about
Being effectively a "first gloss of artificial intelligence as a human
pursuit," I believe this course should give you a modern and critical
perspective and skillset focused on evaluating claims about AI,
thinking about what makes an artifact intelligent (if that makes any
sense), and basic design and implementation skills for creating
supposedly-intelligent systems. AI is not only about programming
machines. There are strong (and contentious) philosophical,
psychological, and social overtones to all AI research. We'll attempt
to understand some of that, as well as build useful software.

* What to expect
Mostly, you'll be required to do a lot of reading, programming, and
mathematically-oriented problem-solving. Except for homework 5, in
which you practice programming in Prolog, you can choose which
programming language(s) you use. (I'll try to demonstrate Python code,
usually). Some assignments, however, will ask you to read texts and/or
listen to podcasts and do some critical thinking.

All homework solutions must be submitted on the CSE Linux servers,
using the ~submit~ command. All programs must compile and execute
without error on the Linux servers. Thus, be sure to test your code
on those servers before submitting it!

Instructions about the Linux servers are available in [[./linux.html][lecture notes]].

* Text book
While I do not require that you have the text book, there is an
official text book for this class: [[http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Edition/dp/0136042597/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1332257784&sr=1-1][Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach]], by Russell and Norvig. You can get the 3rd or 2nd edition;
the 1st edition is a bit out-of-date.

I suggest you buy the book if you like "another opinion" on
matters. It's a good book. Most lecture topics in this class have
corresponding sections in the text book; look at the [[./calendar.html][course calendar]]
for the relevant pages. Again, whether you buy the book or not is up
to you; it is not required.

The text book is very popular; over 1,200 universities currently use
this book for their AI courses. This means that the internet is
saturated with lecture notes, homeworks, exams, etc. for very similar
introductory AI courses. Additionally, an entire introductory AI
course can be experienced at [[http://www.ai-class.com][ai-class.com]], taught by Sebastian Thrun
and Peter Norvig (one of the authors of the text book).

* Grading
  - Homeworks: 40% (8 of them; 1--5 and 7--9; "6" is skipped because
    there is no homework for week 6; we have the midterm instead)

  - Midterm: 30%

  - Final: 30%

There will be abundant extra credit opportunities. These are described
in the relevant homeworks.

Late work is penalized 10 points, no matter how late it is.

Note that if I suspect you copied your homework solutions from someone
(or something) else, I reserve the right to ask you many probing
questions about those solutions. If you do not answer those questions
to my satisfaction, I reserve the right to give you a 0% grade on that
homework.

* Exams
We have two exams: the midterm and the final. The midterm covers
search and logic; the final covers everything. You will not be asked
programming questions on the exams. All questions will ask you to
perform calculations or answer questions with regular prose.

* Time expectations
You should operate under the expectation that homework assignments
will take longer than you expect. Trivial bugs in your code can cause
you to waste hours attempting to fix your program. The last 10% of the
work takes 90% of the time. And so on... So start early!

* Academic misconduct
This course is designed for individual work.

The only work required of you outside of class is homework
assignments. Obviously, there is no tolerance for cheating (looking at
others' work) during the midterm or the final exam. However, you may
participate in a reasonable amount of collaboration over
homeworks. Collaboration is limited to: discussing how to approach the
solution, or how to solve small coding problems; looking at the
Internet for information about general topics, not solutions to the
particulars of the homework assignment. It is considered academic
misconduct if you copy significant portions of code from anyone (the
Internet included). Your solutions should not bear an uncanny
resemblance to anyone else’s code. It should be clear to you what I
mean by this; do not test the limits of this (fairly liberal)
policy. Violators will be referred to the OSU Committee on Academic
Misconduct (COAM).

* Disability statement
Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss your
specific needs. Please contact the Office for Disability Services at
614-292-3307 in room 150 Pomerene Hall to coordinate reasonable
accommodations for students with documented disabilities.
