  - genetic representation :: a format for describing the parameters
       of an individual; often a string of 0's and 1's (binary coding)
       or string of letters is used

  - fitness function :: a function that receives as input a genetic
       representation and returns as output a number such that higher
       fitness values means the genetic representation describes an
       individual closer to the goal

GA's are most often used when goals are not entirely describable. The
fitness function should be able to determine if one individual is more
fit than another, but we may not know what properties the most fit
individual will have. We want the GA to find these properties for us.

  - crossover :: a function that receives two genetic representations
                 and produces a new genetic representation by
                 combining a (random) portion (or portions) of each
                 input; the portions are copied verbatim (no mutation
                 here)

  - mutation :: a function that randomly modifies a genetic
                representation; how many locations are modified is
                typically determined by a parameter (e.g., 5% of the
                genetic representation will be randomly swapped with
                different codes)

The fitness function is one of the most important features of a
genetic algorithm. Obviously, in human biology, the fitness function
needs at least 12-16 years to calculate (whatever age people can begin
breeding). For the purposes of solving AI problems in a reasonable
time frame, the fitness function should be quite fast, because it will
be executed /many/ times. Typical GA algorithms run for maybe 50,000
or 100,000 generations. However, if the fitness function is something
like, "the simulated efficiency and safety of the commercial airplane
described by this genetic representation," then that fitness function
is probably too complex to use in a GA. Though GAs seem like a good
idea for finding good designs for complex systems, the fitness
functions may become so unweildy that GAs may turn out to be the wrong
approach.
